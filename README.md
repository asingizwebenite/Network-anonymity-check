# Network-anonymity-check
 A script to check network anonymity and  perform whois and nmap scan on an ip address or domain name on a remote server.
 This is to automate the work done in creation of secure hacking environments and reducing the time taken to install different packages needed manually. It also automates the process of making the network anonymous through the use of nipe.
 This script also performs whois and nmap scan on the domain name or ip addresses accessed by the user and the user can change the directory in which the files holding the scan results will be store by changing the value of the variable "OUTPUT_DIR" .
 I used the localhost as my remote server to test the working of the script but for anonimity of course you should switch to using like a VPS so that you can execute the whois and nmap scan and save the results to your local server. To achieve anonimity, you should not use localhost because it is your local server so you should use another server obviously which won't reveal you. This is for those who want to work anonymously but there are other tools which can help achieve anonimity such as the use of tor. Feel free to adjuct the codes according to the needed results but I guess the main things needed are covered in the script.
